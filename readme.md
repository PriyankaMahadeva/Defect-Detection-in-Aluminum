# Defect-Detection-in-Aluminum

Defect-Detection-in-Aluminum is a computer vision project that utilizes a YOLO model for real-time detection of defects in aluminium surfaces. The system processes video frames to identify and highlight potential defects, providing a visual and numerical representation of detected anomalies.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Processes video frames to detect defects in real time.
- **YOLO Integration**: Leverages the YOLOv8 model for accurate defect detection.
- **Dynamic Visual Feedback**: Highlights detected defects with bounding boxes and class labels.
- **Customizable Threshold**: Adjustable confidence threshold for detection.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Runs seamlessly on video inputs for analysis.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV: For video processing and visualization.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations.
  - Ultralytics YOLO: For object detection.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher.
- The following Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy opencv-python ultralytics
